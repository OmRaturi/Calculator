# Calculator
Hello! It's my new calculator I learnt recently
to make from my course.....I used python to make
it as I am learning it and it got 2 more options
for operations which are unique like -
 quotient operation -->
which give only quotient from division and the one
which is useful (maybe? ),
the remainder operation -->
normally when you divide calculator doesn't give
remainder(maybe?)but this one do
soo enjoy it :) 
Thanks
